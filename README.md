# Phonetic translation of English text to IPA

You have to install eng_to_ipa

After copy-paste any English text (replacing buit-in example) simply press the button to receive an answer.

## Transform possibilities:
  
* simple: only IPA text 
  
* normal: normal text & IPA text (each line separately) 

* list: as previous, but if different version of a word, there's variants in brackets
  
Text example: classic English (American) poetry, you all know who is the autor and which is a title :)
